**Welcome to Crossbow wiki!** The main purpose of this documentation is to help developers set up the environment for convenient mobile development with our utility. Depending on the platform you are using, you can select the section (Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker).

Our tool requires **Xcode** or **Android Studio** to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.
